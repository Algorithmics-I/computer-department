# Computer Department

Audie was hired at the computer department in her college, and her first task is to free up space
on each one of the computers. Her first approach was to sort the files and look for the ones
with similar names; however, she notices that sometimes two files can have quite different
names but have the same content. She realizes that reviewing file by file will be too much to
handle, so she thought of a great application idea. However, Audie is a freshman, and that is
why you should help her to write a program where:

- The user can specify the folder that will be scanned.

- The user should be able to filter the files: Should be possible to include or exclude certain
file types.

- It should be possible to identify the files that may be duplicated.

- The user should be able to get:

  - How many files were scanned, how many files are unique, and how many files are
  potentially duplicated.
  
  - List of all the duplicated files.

## Instructions

- You should work with at least 2 types of files. 

- In the problem says to find "potentially duplicated" files. However, you are free to find
files that are 100% duplicates. In the case, that you opt to find "potentially duplicated"
files, you must explain the case in which a file can be marked as a duplicate even though
it is not.

- Get the worst-case analysis of your implementation.

- Make an analysis of the data structures that you are using.

- Your code must be readable and do not include code that is not used. 

- Include unit tests 

- Be mindful when choosing which data structure, algorithm, or library.

## Deliverable

- Java code that solves the problem.

- Document or readme of the analysis.
